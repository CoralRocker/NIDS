Thanks For Trying NIDS!

This is the manual containing information on the game's controls.

## MOVEMENT ##
-> Use the arrow keys to move up and down
-> Pressing 'g' will allow you to enter ghost mode and walk through walls and objects.

## MENU ##
-> Press 'p' to open and close the menu
-> Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu.
-> Use enter to select a menu option, and escape to go back.
 The menu is used to mess around with in-game options and to select objects to place, as well as to save and exit the game correctly.

## OBJECT PLACEMENT ##
WARNING: Object placement is still a WIP, and is therefore unfinished and rudimentary at best.
-> When you have selected an object in the menu, press space to create it in front of you.
-> Move around as you normally do; the object will move with you
-> Press 'q' or 'e' to cycle through different variations of the object
-> Press escape to destroy the object or space to place it down. 
-> Press 'f' to pick up the closest object to you.

## SAVING PROGRESS ##
-> In the menu, select 'Save & Exit', and press enter twice. This will save and exit the game for you, putting the save in a file called 'sav.nidsav'.

## UPCOMING CHANGES ##
* The ability to change object colors
* More objects
* Rotating objects
* Toggling on/off object solidity
* Object depth manipulation
* More game customization options
* The ability to add new objects
