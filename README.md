# NIDS
Naomi Interior Design Simulator. A simple interior design sim I had written in GameMaker Studio 1.4, which is deprecated. Rewritten in SDL2!

# MASTER BRANCH
This branch contains the source code for the game. The game was written in C++/SDL2 on a GNU/Linux machine, and therefore the makefile works for linux only.
To build this, simply clone the repository and use the `make` command to build the project. Thats it!

# Windows Installation
The windows release package is available [here](CoralRocker/NIDS/releases).

# TODO
* Change Object Colors (Partially Finished)

* More in-game options, including movement amount and animation speeds
* Player-Created objects
* Add an undo buffer
* Recreate the color selection UI to be more communicative
* Add color modification mode option?
* Refactor object menu selection
