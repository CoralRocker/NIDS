# NIDS
Naomi Interior Design Simulator. A simple interior design sim I had written in GameMaker Studio 1.4, which is deprecated. Rewritten in SDL2!

# MASTER BRANCH
This branch contains the source code for the game. The game was written in C++/SDL2 on a GNU/Linux machine, and therefore the makefile works for linux only.
To build this, simply clone the repository and use the `make` command to build the project. Thats it!

# TODO
* Change Object Colors
* Add more objects
* Toggle object solidity
* More in-game options, including movement amount and animation speeds
* Player-Created objects
